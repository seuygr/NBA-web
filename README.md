# Score â€“ An NBA Player Strength Visualization Dashboard
The National Basketball Association (NBA) is a men's professional basketball league in North America; composed of 30 teams (29 in the United States and 1 in Canada). It is widely considered to be the premier men's professional basketball league in the world.[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association)

Here in this project, I created a dashboard to visualize each indicidual player's shot data using React, d3 and Ant Design.   
With the help of [d3 shot chart](https://github.com/mamcmanus/d3-shotchart), I could use different filters and themes to provide more customized visualization options. Finally, I developed an autocomplete player search bar to locate a list of players.    

All the data coms from [NBA stats](https://stats.nba.com/) and https://github.com/bttmly/nba

# Shot Chart
Shooting charts can help to identify trends, strengths, weaknesses of each individual player and ultimately to give some insights to improve the team's performance.
